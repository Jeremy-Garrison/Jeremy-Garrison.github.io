I am a PhD student and Graduate Teaching Instructor in the Department of Economics at Colorado State University. I received my masters’ degree from the Department of Economics at CSU in 2022, and I received bachelors’ degrees in Environmental Policy and Mathematics from the University of Tulsa in 2020. My primary research interests revolve around political economy, complexity science, networks, and game theory. I’m currently studying the impact of economic and social network structure on the evolution of cooperation. Most of my work revolves around developing a more nuanced and dynamic understanding of human behavior in economics. In the long term, I am interested in developing a mathematical framework for running social simulations which integrate insights from across social sciences to explore the coevolutionary dynamics of individual behavior and system-level structures and institutions.
