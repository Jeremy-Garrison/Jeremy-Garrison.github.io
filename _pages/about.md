I am a PhD candidate and Graduate Teaching Instructor in the Department of Economics at [Colorado State University](https://economics.colostate.edu/). I hold a master's degree in economics from CSU and bachelor's degrees in environmental policy and mathematics from [The University of Tulsa](https://utulsa.edu/). 

My research focuses on evolutionary game theory, social economics, and cultural economics. More specifically, I am interested in developing theoretical models and employing data to explore the ways in which economic ecologies influence the evolution and behavioral expression of our complex repertoires of preferences. My dissertation explores the sociocultural and behavioral consequences of markets and capitalism through theoretical models using cultural evolution, game theory, and networks as well as empirical evidence from folklore, ethnography, and experimental economics. In the future, I hope to extend the application of these methods to questions of ecological economics, stratification economics, and cliodynamics. More information can be found on my [research](research) page.
