The Sociocultural Effects of Markets and Capitalism: Evidence from Folklore and Ethnography. [PDF](/files/The Sociocultural Effects of Markets and Capitalism.pdf){: .btn--research}

>The sociocultural consequences of economic systems have long been debated by social and economic theorists. Recent studies have employed data on the prevalence of concepts and themes within different folklore traditions to explore the cultural effects of economic systems. In this paper, I extend this line of research, employing both the folklore data and an analogous dataset I develop from the eHRAF World Cultures ethnographic collection. These dual folklore and ethnographic datasets complement each other by representing emic (insider) and etic (outsider) perspectives and depicting the internal and external worlds of different cultures. I construct indices to capture economic and sociocultural characteristics to analyze the sociocultural effects of economic systems. The folklore and ethnographic data both suggest that exposure to markets and capitalism results in more anthropocentrism, less ecocentrism, less sacredness assigned to nature, and more social stratification. Instrumental variable analyses support a causal interpretation of these findings, providing evidence in favor of cultural/historical materialism. The relationships between economic systems and morality and prosociality are less clear. In line with arguments delineating the historical specificity of capitalism, the ethnographic results suggest that the sociocultural effects of capitalism are distinct from those of markets and trade more generally.

Social Context and the Evolution of Empathy. [PDF](/files/Social Context and the Evolution of Empathy.pdf){: .btn--research}

>Human societies differ in the social context of their economic interactions: whereas hunter-gatherers depend primarily on familiars for their subsistence, people in market societies depend primarily on strangers. This variation raises a critical question: How does social context influence the evolution and behavioral expression of empathy? Experimental evidence consistently shows that empathy increases with social closeness. Using evolutionary game theory, I examine how empathy evolves in various social-economic ecologies. I situate the evolutionary game on a network with distinct social and economic layers and define empathy as cooperating conditional on social proximity. The results reveal that when interactions occur among both familiars and strangers, discriminatory empathy outperforms unconditional cooperation, but when interactions occur only among strangers, empathy produces no cooperation. These findings highlight the behavioral consequences of modern human ecologies characterized by anonymity and provide insights for designing institutions and structuring human ecologies that better foster cooperation.
