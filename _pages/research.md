The Sociocultural Effects of Markets and Capitalism: Evidence from Folklore and Ethnography. Job Market Paper. [PDF](/files/The Sociocultural Effects of Markets and Capitalism.pdf){: .btn--research}

>The sociocultural consequences of economic systems have long been debated by social and economic theorists. Recent studies have employed data on the prevalence of concepts and themes within different folklore traditions to explore the cultural effects of economic systems. In this paper, I extend this line of research, employing both the folklore data and an analogous dataset I develop from the eHRAF World Cultures ethnographic collection. These dual folklore and ethnographic datasets complement each other by representing emic (insider) and etic (outsider) perspectives and depicting the internal and external worlds of different cultures. I construct indices to capture economic and sociocultural characteristics to analyze the sociocultural effects of economic systems. The folklore and ethnographic data both suggest that exposure to markets and capitalism results in more anthropocentrism, less ecocentrism, less sacredness assigned to nature, and more social stratification. Instrumental variable analyses support a causal interpretation of these findings, providing evidence in favor of cultural/historical materialism. The relationships between economic systems and morality and prosociality are less clear. In line with arguments delineating the historical specificity of capitalism, the ethnographic results suggest that the sociocultural effects of capitalism are distinct from those of markets and trade more generally.

Building on Synergies between SDGs:
WASH and Women’s Empowerment in Haiti. *Under Review*. (with Alexandra Bernasek, Niroj Bhattarai, Wisnu Nugroho, and Arisa Thongngam)

>As the 2030 deadline for achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) approaches, many countries are far from meeting their targets. In this paper we focus on interlinkages and potential synergies between SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) in the context of Haiti. Following Caruso et al. (2022) and Kishor and Subiya (2008) we examine how improved  Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) conditions may contribute to women’s empowerment. Our analysis reveals that access to improved water sources, reduced water collection times, and better sanitation facilities in Haiti are positively associated with two measures of women’s empowerment: household decision-making and attitudes toward violence within households. These results support an approach to WASH policies that develops synergies between improved WASH conditions and women’s empowerment, that is sensitive to rural-urban differences, and that will be sustainable in meeting people’s water and sanitation needs in Haiti
